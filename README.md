# OIBSIP - Oasis Infobyte Internship Tasks 🚀

This repository contains the tasks completed as part of the **Oasis Infobyte Data Science / Machine Learning Internship (OIBSIP)**.

## 📂 Projects in This Repository

### 1. Email Spam Detection 📧
**Folder:** `Email-Spam-Detection`

**Description:**  
A machine learning project that classifies messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using:
- TF-IDF Vectorizer for text feature extraction
- Naive Bayes Classifier for classification

**Features:**
- Loads a real-world spam dataset (`spam.csv`)
- Preprocesses and vectorizes text data
- Trains and evaluates a classification model
- Achieves around **97% accuracy**
- Predicts whether a new message is spam or not

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## 📌 How to Use
Each project folder contains:
- Source code
- Dataset (if required)
- A detailed `README.md` with instructions to run the project

## 🎯 Purpose
These projects are created to demonstrate practical understanding of:
- Data preprocessing
- Machine learning model training
- Model evaluation
- Real-world problem solving using Python
